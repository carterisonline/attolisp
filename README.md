# Attolisp - The tiniest Lisp

Attolisp is a language meant for a small footprint, and a relatively powerful instruction set. It can be run in a NPM project, or embedded in legacy Processing.js.

## How to build

Make sure you've run `npm i` prior to issuing any of these commands.

- For __Debugging__: `npm run start` (for a developer server)
- For __Type Debugging__: `npm run start-debug`
- For __Production__: `npm run build-legacy` (for exporting to legacy Processing.js)
